Assignment

Create a Google search page in HTML5 (JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML), according to the given design.
You’ve to use RequireJS in your solution and you’re not allowed to use any other framework. You’re also
not allowed to use any back-end technology (for example: PHP, Node, etc…). You can use the old
Google search API (https://developers.google.com/web-search/docs/), but you’re not allowed to use
the Google search JavaScript library. You can’t ask any questions about the design, so use your intuition
to come up with a proper solution if something is not 100% clear.
We’ll test your page on Chrome version 31.x and support for more browsers is a plus but not required.
We’ll check your solution on the following criteria:
   RequireJS usage
   HTML5 Semantic elements usage
   CSS3 usage
   Code readability and maintainability
   Error handling

Design
A simple Google search page, that shows both the image results of your search query as well as the normal Google search results.
